IMDB-import
===========

Data importer for the [public IMDB files](http://www.imdb.com/interfaces).

Only imports:
* actors.list
* actresses.list
* movies.list
* genres.list
* ratings.list

It uses Python and Postgres.

The data is huge so there is also the option to build a lighter version of the Database based on a list [Top 1000 Actors and Actresses](http://www.imdb.com/list/ls058011111/) by [hagennelson](www.imdb.com/user/ur39602325/)
